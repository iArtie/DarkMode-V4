# <cg>Support My Work</c>

Hey!

If you'd like to support what I do, you can do so through PayPal:  
<cy>[Link to my PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/BitZ0wo)</c>

There's absolutely **no pressure** to donate just the fact that you're here means a lot to me. <3


# <cr>No Need to Donate</c>

I'm a university student who understands how valuable money is.  
I don't need donations, and I don't want anyone to feel obligated. Especially if you need that money for yourself.  

So please, think twice before donating.  
<co>Take care of your needs first.</c>

That being said, if you still choose to support me out of kindness, I truly appreciate it with all my heart! :D.


# <cb>Thank You!</c>

Even if you just read this message or showed interest in helping, I deeply appreciate it.  
Your support. Whether it's through donations, kind words, or just using what I make, means the world to me.

<cg>Stay safe. Take care of yourself. Keep being awesome. <3</c>
